Source code for my Nekoweb site. Feel free to copy it because [copying is an act of love.](https://copyheart.org/manifesto/) If you do copy a lot of my code, please credit me! Thanks!  

Please note that my website is NOT a template. [Hugo xmin](https://xmin.yihui.org/) and [11ty base blog](https://demo-base-blog.11ty.dev/) are very similar to my site and are proper templates!

## Running my site locally
If you want to run my site locally you will need to run these commands:
``` 
npm install
npm run watch
```
- `npm install` : Download the required npm packages. If you want to see which packages are downloaded look at the import section of the [eleventy.config.js](/eleventy.config.js) or [package-lock.json](/package-lock.json).
- `npm run watch`: Script that runs `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve --watch --incremental`

Then, open `http://localhost:8080` in the browser.
